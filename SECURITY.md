# Security Policy

Binary Refinery is intended for **static** malware analysis,
but it is nevertheless recommended to never analyze malware outside a sufficiently secured, preferably virtual, environment.
That said, refinery units should be robust against any input and never performed uncontrolled execution of any part of the input.
Should you identify any security vulnerabilities in the toolkit, please file a 
[bug report](https://github.com/binref/refinery/issues/new?assignees=huettenhain&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md).

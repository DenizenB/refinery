# The Conscience of a Hacker[*](http://www.phrack.org/issues/7/3.html)

_I made a discovery today._
_I found a computer._
_Wait a second, this is cool._
_It does what I want it to._
_If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up._  
  _Not because it doesn't like me..._  
  _Or feels threatened by me..._  
  _Or thinks I'm a smart ass..._  
  _Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here..._

_And then it happened..._
_a door opened to a world..._
_rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins,_
_an electronic pulse is sent out,_
_a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought..._
_a board is found._  
  _"This is it... this is where I belong..."_  
  _I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them,
may never hear from them again... I know you all..._  
  _Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike..._

_You bet your ass we're all alike..._
_we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak..._
_the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless._
_We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic._
_The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils,_
_but those few are like drops of water in the desert._

_This is our world now..._
_the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud._
_We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap_
_if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons,_
_and you call us criminals._
_We explore... and you call us criminals._
_We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals._
_We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias..._
_and you call us criminals._
_You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat,_
_and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good,_
_yet we're the criminals._

_Yes, I am a criminal._
_My crime is that of curiosity._
_My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like._
_My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for._

_I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto._
_You may stop this individual,_
_but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike._

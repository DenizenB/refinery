    "That is a little disappointing; this doesn't look like we found the C2 servers. It'd still be nice to understand how that pipeline works, so, let's take it apart step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we use [emit] to output the contents of the malware sample.\n",
    "2. We then use [put] to store the contents of the current chunk in a meta variable called `bin`. This creates a \"backup\" copy of the data, because we are about the change the contents of the buffer.\n",
    "3. We run [rex] to search for the opcode sequence of pushing a nonzero byte and a 32bit-integer address to the stack - these are our candidates for the length and address of an encrypted string as they are being passed to the string decryption function. The output of [rex] is defined by the format string `{1}{2}` which means to simply concatenate the first and second match group - in this case, this will be the single byte encoding the string length and the four bytes encoding its address.\n",
    "4. We use the [struct] unit to parse the integers from the opcode sequence: The struct format `{n:B}{a:L}` contains two format fields: `{n:B}` to read the one-byte string length value into the variable `n`, and `{a:L}` to read the 4-byte string address value into the variable `a`. Finally, the last argument of this [struct] call is `{bin}`, which defines the body of the output. This variable still contains the contents of `a.bin` and after this command, the output will be several copies of `a.bin`, and each of them has meta variables `a` and `n` defined, specifying the virtual address and length of what is likely an encrypted string.\n",
    "5. We use [vsnip] with the argument `a:n` to extract the `n` bytes at the virtual address `a`. We also specify the quiet flag `-Q` to silence warnings that will inevitably happen because some of the opcode sequences we extracted are false positives.\n",
    "6. We should now be looking at a stream of encrypted strings, each of which we decrypt by using the [xor] unit.\n",
    "7. We use [peek] with the `--brief` and `--esc` options to get an overview of all the strings we decrypted.\n",

Invisible chunks are passed on along the frame, but refinery units to not operate on them. Hence, the first [vsnip] command is only executed on the visible chunk, extracting the 13 key bytes from their known address. The invocation of [pop] does two things: It takes the first visible chunk in the current frame and associates it with the variable `key`. Then, it makes all remaining chunks visible again and attaches the variable `key` to them. In this case, we end up with a copy of the original sample, with a variable named `key`, containing the decryption key.
